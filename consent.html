		<h1>What is this?</h1>
		<p>This is an interface that represents a musical major scale in order to teach what that scale sounds like.</p>
		<h1>What will happen?</h1>
		<p>This study is divided into three sections. The first section is a benchmark (represented by squares), the second and largest section is learning (represented by circles), and the final section is the benchmark again (represented by squares).</p><br>
		<p>It will take less than 5 hours to complete, but could be as quick as ~30 mins. You can come and go whenever you like, so you don't have to do it all in one sitting.</p><br>
		<p>In the beginning of the learning section, you will have lots of help. But as you get through it, you'll have to rely on yourself more and more.</p><br>
		<p>After that, you'll be asked to compete a short survey about your experience.</p>
		<h1>What do I do?</h1>
		<p>You sing! Use your voice to make put the ball in the highlighted area. You may hear a note first, and you may be able to click the highlighted area to hear it again.</p><br>
		<p>Sing the note until the bubble fills the entire middle area.</p><br>
		<p>Don't be afraid to just play around. You'll probably want to wear headphones, too.</p><br>
		<p>You can always come back and read this consent and instructoins by clicking the link at the top.</p>
		<h1>OK, what now?</h1>
		<p>If this still sounds good, read the consent form and decide if you would like to participate:</p>
